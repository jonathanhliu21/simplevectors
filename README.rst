Simplevectors
=============

Simple, embeddable, and extendable vector implementations in C++.

**NOTE**: C++11 or higher is needed for this library.

**NOTE**: This is mostly tested on MacOS 12.6 with C++11, clang 13.0.0, CMake 3.22.2, and GNU make 3.81.

Quickstart
----------

This is a very basic example of simplevectors. First, download ``simplevectors.hpp`` from the releases page on the GitHub repository, then paste the code below:

.. code:: cpp

   #include "path/to/simplevectors.hpp"

   int main(){
      svector::Vector<2> vector2; // creates a 2D-vector
      svector::Vector2D
          vector2d; // creates a 2D-vector with 2D-specific functionality

      svector::Vector<3> vector3; // creates a 3D-vector
      svector::Vector3D
          vector3d; // creates a 3D-vector with 3D-specific functionality

      svector::Vector<4> vector4; // creates a 4D-vector
   }
