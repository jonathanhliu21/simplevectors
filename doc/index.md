# Simplevectors Documentation

Simple, embeddable, and extendable vector implementations in C++.

@note C++11 or higher is needed for this library.

@note This is mostly tested on MacOS 12.6 with C++11, clang 13.0.0, CMake 3.22.2, and GNU make 3.81.

## Quickstart

This is a very basic example of simplevectors. First, download `simplevectors.hpp` from the releases page on the GitHub repository, then paste the code below:

```cpp
#include "path/to/simplevectors.hpp"

int main(){
  svector::Vector<2> vector2; // creates a 2D-vector
  svector::Vector2D
      vector2d; // creates a 2D-vector with 2D-specific functionality

  svector::Vector<3> vector3; // creates a 3D-vector
  svector::Vector3D
      vector3d; // creates a 3D-vector with 3D-specific functionality

  svector::Vector<4> vector4; // creates a 4D-vector
}
```
